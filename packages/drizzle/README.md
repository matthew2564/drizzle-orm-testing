## Intro
Use the `drizzle-orm` package to create a MySQL select statement. This repo contains conditional logic which affects the output of the statement based on a passed payload.

## Layout
1) Define table schema (found in `src/schema.ts`)
2) Define logic for constructing statement (found in `src/index.ts`)
